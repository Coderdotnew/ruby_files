# Running a Ruby file

So, we've written all this amazing code...or have we? How do we know if our code works? Well, why don't we run the file to check out if it does what we want it to!

Let's use the most basic example we have in the world of coding: hello_world. In our example, our text file is pretty simple. It just has a couple words: "puts "Hello world!"" (you'll see this example and what the code is actually doing in our first lesson).

Now that we have our code written, we need to save it so that we run the most up-to-date file. (Same way as you would save a document in Word: File > Save, or CMND+S keyboard shortcut). Next we need to move down into our terminal. We should currently be in our root directory (~/workspace), but lets do a "ls" command to make sure.

Cool. So, one of the most important things about running a ruby file is making sure that you are in the directory where your file is saved. If, for example, we tried to run our "Hello_world" file while we were in the (~/workspace) directory our computer wouldn't know where the file was. 

So, let's do that. Change directory (cd) into the folder that holds your file (in our case that's the "example/" directory).

Okay, now we are in the right place to run our file to check our code/run our program. To run the file you simply type "ruby" before the name of your file, and click enter!

Our program "put" the text "hello world!" onto the terminal just as we asked it to! (...You'll just have to trust us for now that that's what we wanted it to do until you learn about Ruby syntax)

Good work. Now let's start creating!
